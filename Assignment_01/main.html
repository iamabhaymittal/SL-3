		<p>Whether you love first-person shooters or hunting for treasure in pixelated paradises, there are times when you’ve wanted a little more from your gaming experience.</p>
        <p>Maybe you want to experience your virtual worlds in higher definition, or you’re curious about exactly what makes your computer run the way it does.
        </p>
        <p>Building your own computer is the answer. Not only do you have complete control over which components you choose, you also get to peer under the hood and see what makes a PC run.
        </p>
        <p>If that sounds intimidating, take a deep breath and relax. There’s no need to break out the soldering iron. All you need to build your first gaming computer is the right set of parts, a screwdriver, and some patience.
