ER Exercise

Q.1 ) Draw an ER diagram that encodes the following business rules.

Chefs work at restaurants. A chef is uniquely identified by an SSN,
and is also described by a name and a cuisine in which she
specialized. A restaurant is uniquely identified by a combination of
name and city. Each chef works in at least one restaurant, and each
restaurant must have at least one chef working at it. Some chefs own
restaurants, and if a chef owns a restaurant - she is its sole owner.
